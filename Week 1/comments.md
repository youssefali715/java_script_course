Here are some good use cases of comments in JavaScript:

- To explain the purpose of a piece of code or function.
- To provide information about the inputs and outputs of a function.
- To document the assumptions made by a piece of code.
- To mark out sections of code that are not currently in use.
- To debug code by commenting out lines of code or entire functions.

Here are some bad practices when using comments in JavaScript:

- Using comments to explain what the code is doing. If the code is well-written, it should be self-documenting and comments are not needed.
- Using comments to repeat the code. This is redundant and adds unnecessary clutter to the code.
- Using comments to swear or vent frustration. This is unprofessional and can make the code difficult to read.
- Using comments to make the code look longer than it is. This is a form of code bloat and can make the code difficult to maintain. Here are some additional tips for using comments in JavaScript:
  - Use single-line comments (//) for short comments.
  - Use multiline comments (/\* \*/) for longer comments.
  - Start comments with a verb to indicate the purpose of the comment. For example, "This function adds two numbers together."
  - Keep comments concise and to the point.
  - Update comments when the code is changed.

By following these best practices, you can use comments to make your JavaScript code more readable, maintainable, and understandable
