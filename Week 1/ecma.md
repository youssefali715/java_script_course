ECMA International (Ecma) is a non-profit standards organization for information and communication systems. It was founded in 1961 as the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), but changed its name in 1994 to reflect its global reach and activities.
Ecma's mission is to develop and promote standards for information and communication systems that are widely adopted and used in the global marketplace. The organization's standards are developed through a consensus-based process that involves industry experts from around the world.
Ecma's standards cover a wide range of information and communication technologies, including:

- Programming languages (such as ECMAScript)
- Networking protocols (such as WebSocket)
- User interfaces (such as Common Language Runtime)
- Security (such as Web Authentication)
- Cryptography (such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Cloud computing (such as Open Virtualization Format)

Ecma's standards are widely used by industry vendors and developers. They help to ensure that products and services are interoperable and that users can have a consistent experience across different platforms and devices.
Ecma is a member of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This means that its standards are aligned with the standards developed by these other organizations.
Ecma is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It has offices in Europe, North America, and Asia.
Here are some of the benefits of using ECMA standards:

- Interoperability: ECMA standards ensure that products and services from different vendors can work together seamlessly. This is important for businesses and consumers who want to be able to use their devices and software with a variety of other products and services.
- Innovation: ECMA standards help to accelerate innovation by providing a common framework for developers to build on. This can save time and money, and it can also help to ensure that new products and services are interoperable with existing ones.
- Confidence: ECMA standards give users confidence that the products and services they use are reliable and secure. This is important for businesses that need to ensure that their data is safe, and it is also important for consumers who want to be able to trust the products and services they use.

If you are looking for a reliable and secure standard for your information and communication technology products and services, then you should consider using ECMA standards
